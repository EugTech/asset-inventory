# Welcome to the Asset Inventory Open-Data project
This welcome letter comes to you from the fine folks at EugeneTech in the SiliconShire.  Thanks for volunteering for our first open-data project.  We're glad you are here :tada:

### Vision
The vision for this project is: To inventory specific areas in Eugene to support studies and grants by working openly to publish open data APIs and web-based data entry tools.

### Plan
We'll be [meeting weekly](https://www.meetup.com/EugeneTech/events/qhlbtqyzfbrb/) online & IRL to work thru the issues maintained in the [planning repository](https://github.com/EugTech/asset-inventory). 

The first meeting is 5:15 Wednesday at CodeChops conference room above The Barn Light, 44 West Broadway #206.  This coincides nicely with a planning meeting happening 3-5 about the Innovation District project, One of the studies mentioned in the vision.  

Leaders will maintain milestones and work with partners to align with goals.  Web developers will create UI and APIs for loading and viewing asset data.  Data technicians will concern themselves with on-boarding and collating data. Meet IRL at [CodeChops](https://codechops.com) or jump into the [ZOOM room](https://hp.zoom.us/my/markdav.is) online. 

### Tools
The currently proposed tool set is [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/) for web UI and [AirTable](https://airtable.com/) to store the data.  These tools were selected as a starting point because they are free and web-based. The team can self-select other tools.  Any hosting will be provided by [MVP Studio](https://mvpstudio.org/)

### Collaboration
We are using the [EugeneTech Slack](https://eugslack.com) for chat.  Find the #open-data channel.  There is a private planning channel as well.  That's mostly for leaders and partners.

## Partners
We are working with the Chamber of Commerce and various City of Eugene agencies to inventory assets for two projects:

- [Innovation district study area](https://www.brookings.edu/innovation-districts)
- [UNESCO Creative Cities grant](https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/home)
