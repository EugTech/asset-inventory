## inventory of assets that support innovation in a study area in eugene

We have a small open-data project.  It's an inventory of assets in a study area (Core Eugene) that support innovation.  Things like Health & Social Services, Arts, Tech, Social Spaces, Innovation Cultivators, etc.  It's a simple list of addresses and a blurb about each one.  There will be more data later but this is focused start for a research projects.
